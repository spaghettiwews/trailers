### Problem

I like movies, but because I'm a fairly busy and lazy guy (_mostly lazy_) I don't have the time to find and curate my own list of stuff I'd like to watch. I prefer that someone else do that for me. That's why I like The Verge's "New trailers you have watch" series - it makes it easier for me to just peruse the latest trailers and decide what to invest my time in. Still, even with that I have to visit the site regularly to check if there's any new content. Like I said, I'm busy and frankly ain't nobody (_I just realised that this is a double negative_) got time for dat.

### Solution

This is a shell script that scrapes The Verge's Film archives for trailers and collates them into a single page which is far much easier (_I think it is_) to browse because it only contains the trailers, nothing else. This probably could have been easily achieved using a RSS client with a simple filter, but where's the fun in that.

If you spot any noob errors in there, don't judge me harshly, I wrote this while taking this [Unix Tools course](https://www.edx.org/course/unix-tools-data-software-and-production-engineering).

### Contribution

If you find errors, or have any improvements/recommendations feel free to open an issue. I'd appreciate it.
